  <p>I've been in Atlanta, Georiga for 21 years. In 2014, I graduated Emory University with a bachelors in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology. During my first two years of college, I was part of the Wommen's Tennis team. I currently work at Grady Memorial Hosptial in the 911 EMS Operations as a AEMT. In 2018, along with two other partners, started a social media advertising businness. I decided to enroll into the Georgia Tech Bootcamp to gain the skills to help my company.</p>
